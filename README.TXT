 Dear Reader, 
 
 This project was for my Second Year - Semester Two - Object Orienatated Development- End of Year - Final Project
 
 This project uses the .NET Framework to create an XAML interface that includes images which are hosted on S3 buckets using AWS.
 
 This project was designed to be a till system for a bar. 
 
 The project connects to a database which contains all the details of all drinks used in the till system. 
 
 The project was created using a Database - First approach
